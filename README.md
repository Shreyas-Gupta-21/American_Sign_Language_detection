# American_Sign_Language_detection
This my project to detect american sign language alphabets from A-Z . 
From Data creation to prediction and making a CNN model all the work is done by itself . 
Thanks to various articles and stackoverflow to help me out whenver I got stuck in between.
I cannot able to upload my model.h5 file and dataset (If you need them please ping on linkedin)
